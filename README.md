## About the Project
Bird species identification is a challenging **fine-grained classification** task because species often differ by subtle visual cues (e.g., beak color, tail shape).

This repository implements and compares three approaches:
- **RA-CNN (Recurrent Attention CNN)**  
- **MA-CNN (Multi-Attention CNN)**  
- **Part-based R-CNN**

All experiments use the [CUB-200-2011 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenewone/cub2002011). The project contains data preprocessing, model implementations, training scripts, evaluation scripts, and a lightweight demo for inference.

Key features:
- Attention-based localization of discriminative regions.
- Part-based detection for pose-normalized representations.
- Clean training pipeline with data augmentation.
- Option to deploy as a web demo (Streamlit/Flask).
